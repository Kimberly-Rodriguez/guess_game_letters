## Tools

This application was built using JavaScript and Web APIs

## Specification

- When a user presses a letter key, the user's guess should be captured as a key event.

- When a user correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank "_" should be replaced by the letter. For example, if the user correctly selects "a", then "a _ _ a _" should appear.

- When a user wins or loses a game, a message should appear and the timer should stop.

- When a user clicks the start button, the timer should reset.

- When a user refreshes or returns to the brower page, the win and loss counts should persist.
